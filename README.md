Hi! My name is Iris, and I am passionate about working with others to create tools and generate insights to help the people and communities around me. I am a Master's student studying Computer Science, focusing on ML/AI, at the University of California, San Diego. I recently graduated from the University of Washington, where I majored in Mathematics and conducted research in computing education and Data Science for disaster recovery.
